# Face-identificaton-2

It is my eighth project. It is made following this tutorial: "https://towardsdatascience.com/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-b738bb0f7348"

This project allows you to collect faces photos, train model with them and at the end identify, who is the person on the photo/camera, based on photos you trained your model with.
